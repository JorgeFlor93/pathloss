# Changelog
All changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [8.1.9] - 2020-03-09

## [8.1.8] - 2020-03-02

(websocket server) fix regression with disabling zlib extension on the server side. If a client does not support this extension the server will handle it fine. We still need to figure out how to disable the option.

## [8.1.7] - 2020-02-26

(websocket) traffic tracker received bytes is message size while it should be wire size

## [8.1.6] - 2020-02-26

## [8.1.5] - 2020-02-23

(server) give thread name to some usual worker threads / unittest is broken !!

## [8.1.4] - 2020-02-22

(websocket server) fix regression from 8.1.2, where per-deflate message compression was always disabled

## [8.1.3] - 2020-02-21

(WebSocketServer) add option to disable deflate compression, exposed with the -x option to ws echo_server

## [8.1.1] - 2020-02-18

(ws cobra to statsd and sentry sender) exit if no messages are received for one minute, which is a sign that something goes wrong on the server side. That should be changed to be configurable in the future

## [8.1.0] - 2020-02-13

(http client + sentry minidump upload) Multipart stream closing boundary is invalid + mark some options as mandatory in the command line tools

(snake) add an option to disable answering pongs as response to pings, to test cobra client behavior with hanged connections 

## [8.0.5] - 2020-01-31

(IXCobraConnection) set a ping timeout of 90 seconds. If no pong messages are received as responses to ping for a while, give up and close the connection

## [7.5.4] - 2019-12-16

(websocket client) improve the error message when connecting to a non websocket server

Before:

```
